Python implements merged linked lists_Python implements the basic structure and basic methods of bidirectional circular linked lists This article introduces the implementation principle of a bidirectional circular linked list, including class definition, basic attribute methods (such as determining null, length, traversal), and core operations (head insertion, tail addition, arbitrary position insertion, node search and deletion). It shows how to use the bidirectional feature to simplify node operations and discusses its advantages over ordinary bidirectional linked lists.The summary is generated by CSDN through intelligent technologyThe bidirectional circular linked list is developed on the basis of the bidirectional linked list. The last node of the bidirectional linked list points to the starting node, and the previous node of the starting node points to the last node, thus obtaining a bidirectional circular linked list.A bidirectional circular linked list has more advantages than a bidirectional linked list. There are many optimizations in adding and deleting nodes. Nodes can be added or deleted without looping through the entire linked list from the starting point.First, define the basic class of the doubly linked list and the basic class of the node: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21f6f0ec-99fc-47f0-a498-339205fab86e)

class Node:
    def __init__(self, item):
        self.item = item  # 该节点值
        self.next = None   # 连接一下一个节点
        self.prev = None  # 上一个节点值
 
 
class DoubleCircularLinkedList:
    """双向循环列表类"""
    def __init__(self):
        self._head = None
Next, we add the logic of the basic property method. Note that the way to determine whether it is the last node is whether the next node of the last node points to the node pointed to by the head.
